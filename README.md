Repo for Smart India Hackathon


App made for real time tracking of public transport including Metro and Busses.(more in future)

Main Features of the app:
1) Live Map: It Shows real time location of the public transport. It has 2 different modes for transport oen for busses and one for metros.
2) Route Planning: User can select where he is going from and to where and the app will tell which route is faster, tell the price, and also what is the ETA.
3) Live Notification: You can make a daily routine where the app will give you notification when the bus or metro is close to your station and when you should leave to reach before missing the bus.

Extra Features of the app:
1) App will tell you if the incoming bus or metro is full, has some seats or is completely empty.
2) There is an interactive window where you can ask the driver to turn on or off the air conditioner, or inform him if the transport is dirty.
3) The app will use Google maps to tell you more about the stop you are exiting, i.e. , it will tell you about the nearby stores like restaurant, grocery shop, bank,etc.
4) You can share your live location to one of your loved ones, it will automatically stop once you reach your destination.
5) Ticket/Wallet: There is a option to purchase ticket for your transport directly from your phone using upi/card payments. If you travel a lot, you can buy a create a wallet where you can add money and whenever you want a ticket your moeny is directly deducted from wallet which is an easier method.(Also the wallet charges less money than ticket).

Bonus Features(idk how it will work but sounds good)
1) The app will take data and tell you about more populated stops, helpful for a tourist.


Please modify it, this is just a rough sketch of what I think will be good for hackathon. 
If you have any good idea add it in the list and we will see what all we can add.
